# Debian Images for Ansible Molecule

Provides a minimal debian docker image which can be used with ansible molecule tests and should provide most packages needed for builtin ansible modules.

## Images
The Docker images are published every morning at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gentleman1983/ansible_molecule_debian) under the `gentleman1983/ansible_molecule_debian` image.
